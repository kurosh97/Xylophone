# Xylophone

##Goal

The goal of thisis to dive into a simple iOS recipe - how to play sound and use an Apple library called AVFoundation. The most important skill of a great programmer is being able to solve your own problems. I will do that by exploring StackOverflow, Apple Documentation and learning how to search for solutions effectively. By learning to use these tools, Iâ€™ll be able to start adding custom features to an app and get it to do what you want it to.


## What is this app?

I will be making my first musical instrument! Music apps are so popular on the App Store that they even get their own category. 

## What I learned

* How to play sound using AVFoundation and AVAudioPlayer.
* Understand Apple documentation and how to use StackOverflow.
* Functions and methods in Swift. 
* Data types.
* Swift loops.
* Variable scope.
* The ViewController lifecycle.
* Error handling in Swift.
* Code refactoring.
* Basic debugging.
